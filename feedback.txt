For a website designed in sections like slides, the best practice for pixel height is to use a viewport-based approach rather than a fixed pixel height. Here’s how you should approach it:

Best Practices for Slide-Based Website Heights
	1.	Use 100vh for Full-Screen Slides
	•	Each section should be 100vh (100% of the viewport height), ensuring it fills the screen regardless of the device.
	•	Example in CSS:

.slide {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}


	2.	Handle Mobile Screen Heights (Adjust for Address Bar & Safe Areas)
	•	On mobile devices, the browser address bar can affect 100vh, so use 100dvh (dynamic viewport height) or CSS tricks like:

.slide {
  height: 100svh; /* Small viewport height, accounts for browser UI */
}


	3.	Consider Scrolling Behavior
	•	Some users dislike forced full-page scroll snapping. If you use scroll-snap-type, provide an option for normal scrolling.
	•	Example:

html {
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
}
.slide {
  scroll-snap-align: start;
}


	4.	Set a Minimum Height for Small Screens
	•	If the content needs more space, define a min-height:

.slide {
  min-height: 600px; /* Ensures usability on short screens */
}


	5.	Make It Responsive
	•	Adjust for ultra-wide screens:

@media (min-aspect-ratio: 21/9) {
  .slide {
    height: 90vh; /* Avoid too much height on ultra-wide screens */
  }
}



Final Recommendation
	•	Use 100vh for full-page slides.
	•	Adjust with 100dvh or 100svh for mobile screens.
	•	Allow flexibility with min-height for usability.
	•	Test across devices to ensure a smooth experience.

For pages like these, here’s what I’d do in terms of font size, placement, and overall typography design:

1. Headline (Main Title)
	•	Font Size: 4-6rem (64px - 96px) depending on screen size.
	•	Placement: Centered horizontally and vertically for a strong impact.
	•	Font Weight: Extra bold (700-900) to make it dominant.
	•	Line Height: ~1.1 to keep it compact but readable.
	•	Style: Gradient text for emphasis (if brand-appropriate), or mix of weights (e.g., “AI-Powered” bold, “Assistant” regular).
	•	Responsive Adjustments:
	•	On mobile, reduce font size to 2.5-4rem (40px - 64px).
	•	On very wide screens, keep max-width constraints to avoid excessive stretching.

2. Subheadline (Supporting Text)
	•	Font Size: 1.2-2rem (20px - 32px), depending on hierarchy.
	•	Placement: Directly below the headline with ~16-32px spacing.
	•	Font Weight: Regular to semi-bold (400-600).
	•	Line Height: ~1.3-1.5 for better readability.
	•	Style: Slightly muted color compared to the headline for contrast.

3. Call-to-Action (Button Text)
	•	Font Size: 1.4-2rem (22px - 32px), making it prominent.
	•	Placement: Centered below the content with consistent padding (12-24px top/bottom, 40-60px side).
	•	Font Weight: Bold (600-800).
	•	Button Size: Large and touch-friendly (minimum height 48px).
	•	Style: Use a gradient, contrasting color, or hover effect to make it pop.

4. Questions & Bullet Points
	•	Font Size: 1.2-1.6rem (20px - 26px).
	•	Placement: Below the subheadline but clearly grouped together.
	•	Font Weight: Medium (500-600) for clear readability.
	•	Style: Indented list with subtle icons or bullets.

5. Navbar & Login Button
	•	Font Size (Nav Items): 1-1.4rem (16px - 22px).
	•	Placement: Top-right, aligned with a reasonable margin.
	•	Font Weight: Medium (500).
	•	Style: Subtle but readable; increase contrast on hover.

Additional Tweaks for Readability & UX
	1.	Spacing
	•	Ensure a minimum of 16-24px spacing between sections for clarity.
	•	Keep content inside a max-width container (1200px max width for large screens, 90% width for smaller ones).
	2.	Contrast & Color
	•	Keep strong contrast between background and text.
	•	Consider making “partner & producer” or “AI-powered” a different color or weight for hierarchy clarity.
	3.	Mobile Adjustments
	•	Reduce font sizes but maintain proportions.
	•	Keep spacing consistent but compact to fit smaller screens.

These designs are strong, but here are a few tweaks that could improve readability and visual hierarchy:

1. Headline Sizing & Weight

✅ Good: The large, bold headlines establish a clear focal point.
🔧 Improvement:
	•	“More Than Just Another AI Music Tool” – The “Than Just” part could be slightly thicker or larger to emphasize contrast better.
	•	In the “AI-Powered Music Assistant” version, the gradient text looks great, but test a slightly bolder weight (800-900) to enhance readability on mobile.

2. Subheadline Placement

✅ Good: The supporting text below the headline is clear and centered.
🔧 Improvement: Increase top margin (spacing) slightly so it doesn’t feel too close to the title.

3. Button Placement & Visibility

✅ Good: The CTA buttons are large, centered, and high contrast.
🔧 Improvement:
	•	The “LET’S GO!” button could be slightly larger (padding: 16px 48px) to create a more touch-friendly UI.
	•	Try bold text (700-800 weight) inside the button for better contrast.

4. Boxed “Ask Questions Like” Section

✅ Good: The rounded box gives a nice structured feel.
🔧 Improvement:
	•	Reduce opacity slightly on the background OR make the text inside slightly brighter (higher contrast).
	•	Add a tiny top shadow to the box to create a subtle depth effect.

Overall Verdict

✅ Looking great overall! Just a few refinements for contrast, spacing, and button prominence. 🚀 Would you like a quick CSS tweak snippet for these refinements?
